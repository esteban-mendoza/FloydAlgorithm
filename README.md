# The Floyd Algorithm
This repository contains a GUI for the Floyd algorithm implemented in `MATLAB` R2020a to solve the problem of minimum distance between any two nodes of a directed and weighted graph.

The GUI receives an adjacency matrix contained in a CSV file as in `matrizAdyacencias.csv`, where the entry in the _i_-th row, _j_-th column denote the weight between the _i_-th and _j_-th nodes, and 0 is used to denote that there is not an edge between the nodes.

# Binaries for Windows
If you want to run this GUI, you may want to use the provided binaries.  
- Version 9.8 (R2020a) of the MATLAB Runtime is required.
- If you don't have the MATLb Runtime installed in your computer, go to `Binaires/for_redistribution`, download and install `MyAppInstaller_web.exe`.
